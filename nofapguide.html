	<title>Nofap guide by AJQ</title>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>In this guide I will attempt to guide you through your journey of nofap, and I warn you that there's an emphasis on attempt, as I 
can't hold your hand when you want to relapse and quite frankly even if I could, I shouldn't. The value of this whole journey you're
embarking on lies in **you** overcoming yourself. You are the obstacle and the ladder you will use to climb over said obstacle.</p>
	<p>Below are what I consider to be essential things that I needed to be aware of to start living the nofap lifestyle. Remember though,
you've never really beaten your addiction, you can always fall in a matter of seconds no matter how far you've climbed. I don't claim to have come up with this information, I will refer to the sources of it when I feel like it's necessary. The three pillars will help
you take control of your PMO addiction, these I learned from Fapstronaught of the PMO recovery discord server, whom I respect. Before jumping into that though, let's define some terms.</p>
	<b>Porn:</b><p>sexually explicit content used to elicit arousal.</p>
	<b>Masturbation:</b><p>excitation of one's genitals, usually to orgasm. (Usually to orgasm, but the fact is that it's still masturbation even if you stop before orgasm.)</p>
	<b>Relapse(in this context):</b><p>engaging in <b>any</b> of the activities of PMO, unless it's completely outside of your control.</p>
	<b>Wet Dream:</b><p>involuntary release of semen during sleep, it isn't a relapse.</p>

	<h2>I. Commitment</h2>
	<p>Overcoming this addiction requires you realising that PMO (Porn, Masturbation, Orgasm) is degrading your life. I don't want to be the one converting you if you are pro PMO and don't see a problem with it, but if you view the matter in that light, I warn you now that
you will relapse after your supposedly magical "90 day reboot". You don't just need to understand, but believe with your whole being
that PMO is destroying you, otherwise you will inevitably fail when it matters the most. That being said, some common reasons for
starting nofap / semen retention are:<br>
-better cognitive ablities or no "brainfog"<br>
-reset of your prefrontal cortex or "appreciating simple things again due to your brain not getting bombarded by unnecessary dopamine hits<br>
-having a healthier relationship to women due to not fantasizing about perverted things (btw perverted = unnatural in the latin sense  of the word, a crime against nature)<br>
-more energy<br>
-true discipline acquired by beating a very serious addiction<br>
<br>
<p>Involuntary release of semen during sleep, it isn't a relapse.owever, after some 100s of days these things become completely normal to you, this becomes your baseline and you won't feel like it's
special anymore. To me, the one thing that kept me going is the knowledge that my relapse will take me back to the miserable,
nihilistic place I was in before I started my journey. This might happen to you aswell if you came from a "rock bottom" experience.
</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons are, before you start your journey you need to be commited to *never fapping again*. You shouldn't view this as
something that inconviniences you, but rather as an act that frees you from the hedonistic life were leading. This step is argueably 
the most important, as of right now I don't know the way anyone can become commited, it is something you will have to figure out 
yourself. You should consider this not a step, but a pillar of your success, as if it cracks at any moment, the whole house you built
upon it will be decimated. As I've said before, you need to be completely faithful in this on a logical level, of course your crawings
will make you question your decision to quit, but you must know that this is a part of the process and disregard these false voices 
in your head. That is where commitment will become crucial.
</p>
<h2>II. Mindset Change</h2>
<p>When discussing this we must of course talk about a change of mindset. You can't keep thinking the same way and expect a different 
outcome with anything in life. 
</p>
<p>There are many things that you must accept as a part of your daily life as a recovering addict. You will be subject to crawings or 
urges, often many times. Having a strong urge isn't an excuse to relapse. Remember that the worst thing to do while making a recovery
is to relapse. This will essentially reset your progress in most cases, it's never an option to relapse if you truly want to change 
your life for the better. There are many ways to deal with urges, these will be discussed in III. "Transmutation", but for now just
be aware that these things are a becoming a part of your daily life. Don't fight them, accept them, embrace them, be happy for these
are the things that put you above people who masturbate habitually. Wet dreams will also become a part of your new life, these don't
mean a relapse, in fact it means that you have been going for long enough, where your body must discard old sperm cells. It is 
100% natural and something to be celebrated, in fact. 
</p>
<h2>III. Transmutation</h2>
<p>Sexual transmutation means to transfer one's pent up sexual energy into an activity that isn't of sexual nature. This is crucial to
discuss as you will be faced with crawings multiple times daily, some stronger than others. You will be able to subdue them with
methods that don't involve sexual transmutation, such as cold showers or distracting yourself, but you are ultimately best off going 
down the route of transmutation. "Why is that?" you might be wondering, and the answer is simple. You will be able to achieve 10x 
more than you are used to. The best way to sexually transmute is with some task that involves physical action such as working out 
or housework. Mentally challenging activities are usually going to be less successful, because you are preoccupied by the crawing.
</p>
<p>When you get an urge and you successfully transmuted it by working out for example, the urge will have usually subsided, if not then
transmute until it does. You will find that you have a lot more energy than "normal people" and this is one of the best aspects of 
nofap in my opinion.

<h2>Final note</h2>
<p>That's all for now, these are the most important things to master when trying to quit PMO for good. I will add and remove things as I
learn more myself, this is the first edition of my nofap guide, thank you for reading, I would be even happier if you put this to
practice successfully. Remember, nofap is the redpill, now that you know the way towards the good life, you will either acheive it, 
or be forever longing for it in depression...
